            <p>Honestly? I was just trying to learn JavaScript.</p>
            <p>But these larger questions motivated my project
                <li>The most engaging games are ones that donâ€™t have a linear narrative, but a branching one with many unpredictable outcomes. How can I create narrative building blocks so that each playthrough results in a unique story?</li>
                <li>What does my creative process look like when applied to a coding project?</li>
                <li>Why is love so hard to find?</li>
            </p>
            <p>My gracious thanks to Ekaterina Gorbacheva for allowing me to use her Snakes and Ladders <a target="_blank" href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/73834831/Snakes-and-Ladders-Romance">design</a>!</p>
